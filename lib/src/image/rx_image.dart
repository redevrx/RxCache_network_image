  /// ## Design discussion
  ///
  /// ### Why is the default value of [gaplessPlayback] false?
  ///
  /// Having the default value of [gaplessPlayback] be false helps prevent
  /// situations where stale or misleading information might be presented.
  /// Consider the following case:
  ///
  /// We have constructed a 'Person' widget that displays an avatar [Image] of
  /// the currently loaded person along with their name. We could request for a
  /// new person to be loaded into the widget at any time. Suppose we have a
  /// person currently loaded and the widget loads a new person. What happens
  /// if the [Image] fails to load?
  ///
  /// * Option A ([gaplessPlayback] = false): The new person's name is coupled
  /// with a blank image.
  ///
  /// * Option B ([gaplessPlayback] = true): The widget displays the avatar of
  /// the previous person and the name of the newly loaded person.
  ///
  /// This is why the default value is false. Most of the time, when you change
  /// the image provider you're not just changing the image, you're removing the
  /// old widget and adding a new one and not expecting them to have any
  /// relationship. With [gaplessPlayback] on you might accidentally break this
  /// expectation and re-use the old widget.
  final bool gaplessPlayback;

  /// A builder function that is called if an error occurs during image loading.
  ///
  /// If this builder is not provided, any exceptions will be reported to
  /// [FlutterError.onError]. If it is provided, the caller should either handle
  /// the exception by providing a replacement widget, or rethrow the exception.
  ///
  /// {@tool dartpad}
  /// The following sample uses [errorBuilder] to show a 'ðŸ˜¢' in place of the
  /// image that fails to load, and prints the error to the console.
  ///
  /// ** See code in examples/api/lib/widgets/image/image.error_builder.0.dart **
  /// {@end-tool}
  final ImageErrorWidgetBuilder? errorBuilder;

  /// If non-null, the value from the [Animation] is multiplied with the opacity
  /// of each image pixel before painting onto the canvas.
  ///
  /// This is more efficient than using [FadeTransition] to change the opacity
  /// of an image, since this avoids creating a new composited layer. Composited
  /// layers may double memory usage as the image is painted onto an offscreen
  /// render target.

  /// image itself is of a low quality, [FilterQuality.none] may produce
  /// undesirable artifacts. Consider using other [FilterQuality] values to
  /// improve the rendered image quality in this case. Pixels may be misaligned
  /// with the screen pixels as a result of transforms or scaling.

  ///

  /// How to align the image within its bounds.
  ///
  /// The alignment aligns the given position in the image to the given position
  /// in the layout bounds. For example, an [Alignment] alignment of (-1.0,
  /// -1.0) aligns the image to the top-left corner of its layout bounds, while an
  /// [Alignment] alignment of (1.0, 1.0) aligns the bottom right of the
  /// image with the bottom right corner of its layout bounds. Similarly, an
  /// alignment of (0.0, 1.0) aligns the bottom middle of the image with the
  /// middle of the bottom edge of its layout bounds.
  ///
  /// To display a subpart of an image, consider using a [CustomPainter] and
  /// [Canvas.drawImageRect].
  ///
  /// If the [alignment] is [TextDirection]-dependent (i.e. if it is a
  /// [AlignmentDirectional]), then an ambient [Directionality] widget
  /// must be in scope.
  ///
  /// Defaults to [Alignment.center].
  ///
  /// See also:

  ///    specify an [AlignmentGeometry].
  ///  * [AlignmentDirectional], like [Alignment] for specifying alignments
  ///    relative to text direction.

  /// only horizontally and the region of the image to the left and right of
